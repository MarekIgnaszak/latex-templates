## Latex Slides

This latex slide aims for nice typography, minimal aesthetics so the focus is on the content, and a set of helpful commands including easily colored words, full-size image frames, table highlighting, multi-column layouts, and more. The theme is highly customizable with (1) a well commented `preamble.tex` file so you can tweak it and make it your own and (2) by defining the colors in the top of your document:

```latex
% Define `accent`/`accent2` colors for theme customization
\definecolor{accent}{HTML}{006896}
\definecolor{accent2}{HTML}{E64173}

% Beamer theme
\input{preamble.tex}
```
